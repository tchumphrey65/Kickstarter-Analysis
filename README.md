# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project provides an analysis of global funding campaigns for a range of categories that include Film and Video, Music, Games, Food and Technology with Sub Categories in each of those that further delineates the data 
enabling detail analysis in several dimensions that can help gain insights for condusting successfil funding initiatives. 

### Purpose
The purpose is of this project is to analyze the data set to assess and provide insights for successful campaigns by date and to understand successful outcomes by goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis was performed only for theater outcomes by launch date.  Specifically we studied the results by month launched.  There were a total of 1369 theater projects seeking funding.
839 were successful, 493 Failed and 37 were canceled.  The data shows that success spikes in May, drops but remains high in June, further drops in July then returning to the normal level 
of success seen in all other months.  Failues and Cancellations remains relatived flat throughout the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This Analysis was done specifically for play, looking at 1042 plays based on a range of Goal split by less than $1000, greater that $50,000 
and in 5000 increments between.  There is no real trend in the data but some variability over the range.  One point of note for plays none of the the finding initiatives were canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not run into any significant chalanges.  One point I would make is that building the table ranges, the creation of the formulas was time consuming because each had to be done individually, then
copy/pasted and edited.  The ability to make the ranges a variable references in a cell as well as the category would make the table a more powerful and easier to use analysis tool.

## Results and Conclusions

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) There is a spike in successful outcomes the spring / summer months of May, June, July. This would suggest to individuals submnitting theater projects in May for a higher chance of success.

2) Failures and cancelations are effectively flat and independant of month.  Interestingly failures do not decline 
when successes increase and would be worth studying.. The data I woulod study is the number of submissions.  Of interest would be are there more submissions and are a higher percentage approved due mainly to timing and the need for content coinciding with a spike of submissions. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1) Because there are no cancellations the success and failure percentages mirror each other.

2) there is a slight trend downward as the goal increases, altered only by a spike from $35,000 - $45,000

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
1) One of the limitations of the dataset used in the Outcomes Based on Lanch Date is overly broad. Filtering on by the "Theater" as a category as opposed the subcategoy "plays" may limit relevence to Louise as she is interested in plays specifically. 
There are many countries taken into account and interest in plays, as well as money available, can vary by country or even by region within a specific country.  

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1) We could Compare target and percent funded
2) We could do a Box and Whisker chart to look at outliers.
3) We could assess category to size of projects
4) We could compare the success of projects by subcategory within the larger category.
